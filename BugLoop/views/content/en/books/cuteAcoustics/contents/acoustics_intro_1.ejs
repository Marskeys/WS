<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>So, You Want to Become an Expert on Sound?</h2>

<p>
When you begin to delve deeply into any field, you inevitably come face-to-face with a sense of solitude. I may have poured countless hours into understanding a subject, but everyone else has spent their time in entirely different ways. As we embark on this exploration of sound, you may find that the more you study, the closer you grow to the world itself—and the farther you drift from the “people” in that world. The sense of distance you sometimes feel when listening to university professors speak? Before long, others may begin to feel that same distance when talking to you. Terrifying, isn’t it?
</p>

<p>
But there is a wonderful advantage to developing the ability to perceive something deeply.
</p>

<p>
This may sound like an odd comparison, but—have you ever doubted the fact that you were hungry? Most people simply accept hunger as it is; they don’t question the feeling itself. Hunger feels “certain.” It makes you move, seeking food to satisfy it. You know that eating will soon make you full, and because you believe in that outcome—because you look toward the future with a bit of optimism—you’re able to act on it.
</p>

<p>
Solitude is just solitude; it is not the same as pessimism. In fact, good solitude lies on the very opposite side of pessimism. Sound is a surprisingly fundamental subject. And in this journey, we are going to go on a kind of date with sound—getting closer to it than anyone else. Then, when you encounter the many activities and expressions that arise from sound, you will sense the joys within them more vividly than anyone else. And you will savor them. Others may not fully understand the specific delight you are experiencing. That is one form of solitude. But I hope that, through this long journey of becoming familiar with sound, you will come to enjoy that delightful solitude as well.
</p>

<p>
And absolutely—not because I am lonely or trying to recruit companions for my loneliness! Absolutely not!
