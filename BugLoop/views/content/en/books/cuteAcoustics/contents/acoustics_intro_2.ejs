        <h1>Preface</h1>
        <h2>Do We Need Imagination in Acoustics?</h2>

        <p>
        There is a reason I begin this book by talking about solitude.
        Those who imagine are always solitary, in some sense.
        Imagination is ultimately a world that belongs to oneself.
        No matter how vividly I imagine something,
        no one else can see it.
        </p>

        <p>
        Solitude blooms at the boundary between the inner and the outer world,
        and imagination makes that boundary thicker.
        And acoustics is a field where such imagination is indispensable.
        </p>

        <p>
        In an interview, the physicist Richard Feynman once said something
        along these lines. He was responding to an artist friend who criticized
        scientists as dull people who could not simply appreciate the beauty
        of a flower, insisting on analyzing it instead.
        </p>

        <p>
        Feynman explained that even if scientists may not possess the same
        refined aesthetic sensibility as that artist,
        the beauty the artist feels is something others—
        including scientists—can also feel.
        </p>

        <p>
        Moreover, scientists are able to imagine the invisible microscopic world.
        How do the cells of a flower work?
        Why did the flower evolve that way?
        Can insects perceive color as well?
        </p>

        <p>
        By posing such questions through imagination,
        scientists do not diminish beauty.
        On the contrary, those questions add to beauty—
        and to a sense of wonder.
        </p>

        <p>
        Acoustics is not music.
        The sensibility used to express music
        and the sensibility used to understand acoustics
        are not necessarily the same.
        </p>

        <p>
        Of course, when I studied acoustics at a university in France,
        many students and professors did show a tendency
        to enjoy playing musical instruments.
        </p>

        <p>
        Still, acoustics is not an art.
        It is a science—more precisely, a branch of physics.
        If you approach acoustics as an extension of music,
        you may find it rather unfamiliar.
        </p>

        <p>
        This is also one of the reasons why acoustics
        is rarely offered as a major at the undergraduate level.
        </p>

        <p>
        To explore acoustics, one needs physical imagination,
        and that imagination only functions
        when supported by a certain foundation in physics.
        </p>

        <p>
        That is why acoustics is usually offered
        as a specialization in the later years of undergraduate study
        or at the graduate level.
        Even then, it is not very common.
        </p>

        <p>
        This stands in contrast to majors such as computer science
        or English literature,
        which can be found at almost any university.
        </p>

        <p>
        For that reason, this book begins
        with the basic concepts of physics.
        You will not suddenly encounter microphones or decibels
        simply because this is a book about acoustics.
        </p>

        <p>
        As I mentioned earlier,
        we are dealing with a discipline
        that is usually taught at the graduate level,
        all within a single book.
        Some preparation is necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
        Still, I will try to keep it from becoming too difficult.
        That is also why I chose the title
        <em>Cute Acoustics</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
        So, shall we set off
        into the world of acoustics,
        where solitude and beauty intersect?
